12,FULL STACK DEVELOPER WEB3,Simonet Consulting LLC,Hi We are looking for a full-stack Developer Web3 with experience as a blockchain developer or solidity/smart contract developer to create backend and front end as well. We need this to happen quickly and if possible by the end of April or May. So we can offer one coin in our crowdfunding campaign to the higher sponsors who donate $300 or more. For this first series of 10 Films. We are looking to create 2 Million bitcoins at a value of $200 USD each for our (we hope) Award-winning IMAX and THX quality upcoming Documentaries Series of 10 feature films about Asia Ancient Secrets knowledge accompanied by 24 50 minutes complementary documentary episodes for each film providing a total of over 200 hours of content. We are using 16K cameras shooting in raw with a total of 5 cameras; drones jib dolly and lights with a lite crew of 12 to 16 people. 4 camera operators/producers and 1 director and 1 sound engineer and 1 associate sound engineer. Several PA and translators guide bus driver 3 minibusses and several general helpers for physical labor help. We are shooting in Oct/ Nov 2022 editing in Nov/Dec/Jan and delivering it early February. Theatrical release in US France and Canada between May and July 2022. It all depends on our Festivals requirements and what we need to do to enter the Oscars as a candidate. Online Launch Aug 20th or Sept 6th 2022. This will be distributed worldwide first to major Streamers in US Canada and Europe with a 1-month IMAX theatrical release and a second deal after 18 months with a second streamer like Netflix where they will be offered the Award-winning Feature film with 24 brand new 50 minutes each documentaries complementing the film. We calculated roughly a potential $200M profit in 4 years with 3 feature documentaries produced each year for the Asia series. And we will build either in Montreal or in Ibiza we have not decided. Maybe we will build in both places. a full international post-production factory with at least 30 Edit bays and 5 final mixing edit studios to finish each documentary by finishing the visuals with the audio final mastering to generate the masters for Streaming and Theatrical distribution. The editing factory will allow us to produce several series per 4-year cycle with multiple teams on each continent all this to allow us to generate more quickly our content. We will as well as have a full-scale on-demand server farm for the 3rd round of income which will be from the year 2026 and beyond with direct on-demand delivery directly to our end users for rental or digital purchase. 4th round of income is the DVD market but that will be available only 3 months after the film has been released with the major streamer for two months. We will offer the feature film first and then after our second distribution deal with our second streamer has been in effect for 6 months we will release the 24 50 minute episode DVD set of 12 DVDs with 2 50 min. film on each. We will donate a 10 percent share of our revenues from the films produced in their country at minimum to an NGO in the country we cover for each film that we make. Like our first one will be Nepal. So Nepal will receive 10 percent for the life of the content of the revenue generated by it to help the needy and the homeless. We also pay each of our subjects and we work with major helpers like the temple that act as co-producer by introducing us to several other special subjects. Our Subject matter is ancient knowledge that is disappearing and so we will document and donate all of our raw footage to the government public library after we have used it and produced our programs. They will only be able to use it for education and research but they will own a copy of it in their national library. We will focus on public ceremonies and their history and origins but also on private ones like an exorcism shamanism healing divination spirit connection possession and various Universal spiritual teaching like alchemy and more. So our documentaries will benefit the country both with some financial help as well as protecting and recording for future generations an important part of each nation’s knowledge and secret traditions. I will repeat that these can be used in museums and all kinds of educative mediums as well. All commercial copyrights will be owned by our corporation Two Heavens As One Films and its holding company SIMONET Consulting LLC. We also are looking at generating physical products like HD 4K DVD with the bigger edition that will include 13 dvds altogether. 1 for the feature and 12 for the complementary documentary. Job Developer company pay: Pay will be either cash/ wire transfer or 100 percent percentage of Revenues paid In crypto. We would prefer a partner willing to take a pay package made of an agreed percentage of revenue from the production. Plus a small fee once we get our budget but we need a very discounted fee if we are going to offer percentages. Because we could consider between 5% to 7% of our revenue for a series. That is roughly 5-7% of $200M Negotiable. Let’s discuss. We are interested in the developer's help but also the ability to execute a campaign to promote and sell those coins to your existing network of buyers and sponsors and bakers for others products. We need to find backers that will believe our short business plan here and that these sponsors/backers will believe in us reaching $1B revenue by 2030 With series covering North America Europe The Middle East Eurasia Africa South America Australia And the islands of the pacific. And more. Even if they only have the first series of coins that one may have gained a lot of value by 2030. Contact our CEO directly for more info and set up a meeting. We are starting our crowdfunding for the first documentary within the next 30 days and we would like to have the coins or NFTs ready by the end of April or May. Excuse my mistake if I use the wrong words but I am still learning the whole environment. Each coin buyer will receive a digital download copy of the 10 documentaries produced in the series as they become available represented by the crypto coin. If we can generate the coins by the end of March we would actually include the coins in our crowdfunding campaign. With each new series we will add another new 2 million bitcoins or more at a $200 valuation each but we will see as it goes and as we evolve in the production process of these documentaries. We have other products planned that will also be interesting to sell crypto. So let’s start with this one and be successful and we will see what we will do in the future. Thanks for considering us. If you are a single Developer talk to us but be ready to talk about your experience and your existing customers. If you have a small company or a big one please talk to us we want to talk to as many candidates as possible be ready with references as well. Please send us your full resume. Thanks.

Humans have been building since the dawn of time but in the past 150 years the magnitude and scale of engineering projects have only gotten bigger and more complex. As a result there are various people involved in different aspects of the engineering project lifecycle from initial planning to building to maintenance; all these people have different agendas but there is one thing that is common across all fields: data Skand’s vision is to create GitHub for the architectural engineering and construction (AEC) industry. We aim to create a platform that makes it easy to save share and collaborate with all the data that is relevant in the engineering project's lifecycle with the interested parties. As a result we have a wide range of customers in various industries such as Crown Casino Melbourne Metro and Veris just to name a few. Due to the variety of different customers in different industries we deal with a very diverse dataset some easy to deal with such as PDFs images but some much more complicated such as CADs photogrammetry meshes and point clouds that can easily go beyond the sizes of 10s of GBs. This means that we have very interesting engineering problems to solve from building out the scalable data pipelines in the cloud to be able to support processing large amounts of data coming into the platform to building the viewer that the user uses to interact with the data that they have uploaded (have a sneak peek at https://skand.io/webapp-embed/) and this is just the tip of the iceberg!

208,Senior Laboratory Technician,CynLr,"Ideas are as uncluttered as the environment we are in" ABOUT THE ROLE This Role is meant to Design and Build Processes and practices that Augment and Facilitate all members of the Organization to be more Productive and accelerate towards their goals while using the lab as infrastructure while ensuring efficient secure and sustainable usage of the same. Process for the sake of a process will not be entertained. We often tend to question every practice and process if it disrupts productivity and ease of use. Utility & Convenience precedes every other objective. Job Requirements: Skills: Behavioral Tendency: Critical Thinking Initiative Driven Available Responsible Versatile Resourceful Thorough & Attention to Details. Tool knowledge: Evaluation Criteria: Critical Thinking is the fundamental thought culture that we seek in every role that we play at CynLr. To know our assumptions is Critical Thinking. What do we seek ? This role is shaped to be a strong confluence of Practice and Theory. As a startup we are neither blessed with boundless cash to say “theory never matches practice so let’s just jump into getting our hands dirty” thereby lose money and material in blind experiments & endless tinkering / Jugaads without any concrete/viable results nor are we blessed with boundless time to bury ourselves in tallying meaningless symbols in the name of math that cannot find its resemblance to reality. Our pursuit is to Investigate the problem translate it to theory let the theory expose the unknowns design experiments only for the unknowns to be known thereby solving the problem. “Scientifically Informed theoretically tallied and Investigatively experimented” What to expect the work to be like? Expect your work to be entirely entrepreneurial like you run a startup of your own. What does it mean? - Unlike in established organizations the turbulence of the management and even isolated teams will directly impact what you are working on. Sometimes on a daily basis even leading to a change of the entire requirement. Needless to say the exciting yet demanding part of a start-up - every passing day the Company grows. Expect things to be not orderly and requirements to be changing and evolving rapidly beckoning for a heavy modular and scalable design thinking resulting in ease of upgradability serviceability and replaceability. How will your Career Progress? We envision this role to be the genesis of what would eventually be a foundational pillar for all the Technical Infrastructure – Lab and Manufacturing. The problem that we solve is multi-disciplinary and is a perfect confluence of Electrical & Electronics meeting the Software and Mechanical. This brings a unique challenge of blended manufacturing and thereby potentially conflicting Lab Management principles. The Lab is not just a place of Product research and development but is the concept prototype for the larger manufacturing facility that is imminently to be built. Every management principle and infrastructure learning will significantly influence the Manufacturing infrastructure. Hence it demands a foundationally unique approach towards Lab as an Infrastructure Facility management & supply chain. In this context the candidate can expect to help CynLr build organizational capacity in all kinds of Design from Research to Product Development infrastructure to Supply-chain to Facility Operations to Lab Instrumentation or diversify or specialize in any of these domains. ABOUT US Today even the simple task of putting a screw into a screw hole without slipping a thread remains non-automatable across the globe. Imagine what it would take for a robot to assemble a Smartphone or a car (Musk’s words) by putting together 1000s of parts of varied shapes and weights presented in random orientations. Enabling robots to perform Picking Orienting & Placing of objects straight from its container has been a long-standing unsolved problem – touted as The Holy Grail of Robotics and has remained unsolved over 40 years. We at CynLr build the missing pieces of Visual Intelligence for Robotic Arms to make them Object aware to manipulate with superior agility - adapting to the varying shapes orientations and weights of the object – (a demo video link). This we envision could simplify and standardize large customized factory lines into LEGO blocks of micro-factories.
